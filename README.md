# notFlappyBird
 It is not Flappy Bird, because it's in the title
 
----------

I am not the creator of the assets used in this project,
I am also not the creator of the original concept of Flappy Bird,
it is simply a school assignment whose goal was to reproduce a carbon copy of the Flappy Bird game,
it is only an exercise in learning the Unity engine.

Thank you.
